# Counting sort assumes that each of the n input elements is an integer in the range
# 0 to k, for some integer k. When k D O.n/, the sort runs in â€š.n/ time.
# Counting sort determines, for each input element x, the number of elements less
# than x. It uses this information to place element x directly into its position in the
# output array. For example, if 17 elements are less than x, then x belongs in output
# position 18. We must modify this scheme slightly to handle the situation in which
# several elements have the same value, since we do not want to put them all in the
# same position.
# An important property of counting sort is that it is stable: numbers with the same
# value appear in the output array in the same order as they do in the input array. That
# is, it breaks ties between two numbers by the rule that whichever number appears
# first in the input array appears first in the output array. Normally, the property of
# stability is important only when satellite data are carried around with the element
# being sorted.
